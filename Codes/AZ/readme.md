# Scripts for running effective precipitation model for Arizona

Here, we extended our effective precipitation dataset for Arizona from 1986 to 2020 utilizing the trained Western US effective precipitation model. Similar approach can be adopted to extend our effective precipitation model for any Western US states. Moreover, the model has the capacity to be retrained with any newly acquired rainfed ET (training data for effective precipitation) data to refine/update/improve its prediction.
