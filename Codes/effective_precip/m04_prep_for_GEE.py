"""
This scrips converts the effective precipitation monthly datasets into multi-band raster for each model years_list 
from 2000 to 2020. The multi-band rasters are uploaded to GEE as assets and later converted into 
a single multi-band image for all years_list. For 2020, data is available up to September as the monthly datasets
were scaled using a water year fraction model which ends in water year 2020 (doesn't simulate water year 2021).

Details on downloading the dataset with GEE is available on - https://github.com/mdfahimhasan/WesternUS_NetGW
